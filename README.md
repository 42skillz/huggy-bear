# AFRICAN FOOD

### WALY-FAY (NY-STYLE LOFT, JAZZ AND TOP-NOTCH WEST AFRICAN CUISINE) ![radis](./radis.gif) ![group](./group.jpg)
Soft light and typical fabrics for West African specialties to be accompanied with very good wine , rhum or (real) ginger juice. Everything is good in that place where you can also go with a group (but reservation needed). One must try the african-syle roasted chicken. One of the coolest restaurant in PARIS IMO.

# FRENCH FOOD

### Le jardin d'en face (simple but WELL-CRAFTED cuisine in MONTMARTRE)
Tiny restaurant of simple but really well-crafted *cuisine* in the middle of Montmartre. All their products are super fresh  Probably one of the best price/quality ratio you can find in that area. Their *oeuf cocotte au foie gras* is so awesome that you can find it both as a starter or as a dessert (for people that regret not having took it as a starter ;-). All fans of chocolate must also try their *gateau chocolat façon grand-mère*. I've never been disapointed by this address but it's been more than a year that I went there.

### Bonvivant (Inventive WINE BAR in Quartier Latin)
Nice wine bar / wooden bistro chic in the middle of the Quartier Latin (studdents area). Bonvivant tries to smartly reinvent some recipes. I highly recommend the *Burrata des pouilles, betteraves croquantes, huile d'olive et Yuzu* and the *Oeuf mimosa du Bonvivant* (starters) and the *Veritable riz au lait aux amandes caramelisées* (dessert).

# JAPANESE FOOD

### Hokkaido (CLASSICAL but really good RAMENS & Co)
My favorite classical Ramen restaurant in Paris (next to OPERA). The place has been fully renewed, but this is an old institution. Everything is simple but good.

__Price:__ cheap

__Reservation:__ not possible. You just have to follow the queue in the Street 

__Address:__ next to OPERA - 14 Rue Chabanais, 75002 Paris - +33 1 42 60 50 95

### KODAWARI RAMEN (high quality and ORIGINAL RAMENS) ![radis](./radis.gif) 
Discovered recently thanks to Laurent DOGUIN, I'm crazy about it. Top quality products, reinvented recipes of Ramens, Japanese sounds recorded in the streets played as background ambiance. YOU MUST try it if you are 2 or 3 people to eat because the only drawback is the size of this tiny shop. Highly recommended

# INDIAN FOOD

### BHARATH (My favorite SRI-LANKAN CANTEEN at LOUIS BLANC) ![radis](./radis.gif) ![group](./group.jpg)
Place where I used to go every 2 weeks when I lived in the north of Paris, BHARATH is a typical big indian restaurant where you can eat good but cheap food, made with fresh products. I highly recommend the *Koththu Rotti* (SRI-LANKAN specialty) but everything is good. All lhassis and fruit juices are fresh and made on demand.

# ITALIAN FOOD

### Il barone (Best pastas you can find in PARIS?) ![radis](./radis.gif) 
The place is tiny, decorated like an old episode of Sopranos, but all pastas are fresh and made here. This is simply the best pastas you can find in Paris. Their *gnocchis alla rucola* are just completely crazy ;-)
