# Our best food recommendations in Paris
The following list has been made by one of the finest gourmand you can find in the It sphere in PARIS ;-)

# French food

### Le jardin d'en face
Tiny restaurant of simple but really well-crafted *cuisine*. Probably one of the best price/quality ratio you can find in Montmartre. Their *oeuf cocotte au foie gras* is so awesome that you can find it both as a starter or as a dessert (for people that regret not having took it as a starter ;-). I've never been disapointed by this addresse but it's been more than a year that I went there

### Bonvivant
Nice wine bar / wooden bistro chic in the middle of the Quartier Latin (studdents area). Bonvivant tries to smartly reinvent some recipes. I highly recommend the *Burrata des pouilles, betteraves croquantes, huile d'olive et Yuzu* and the *Oeuf mimosa du Bonvivant* (starters) and the *Veritable riz au lait aux amandes caramelisées* (dessert).
