# Our best food recommendations in Paris
The following list has been made by one of the finest gourmand you can find in the IT sphere in PARIS ;-)

# French food

### Le jardin d'en face
Tiny restaurant of simple but really well-crafted *cuisine* in the middle of Montmartre. All their products are super fresh  Probably one of the best price/quality ratio you can find in that area. Their *oeuf cocotte au foie gras* is so awesome that you can find it both as a starter or as a dessert (for people that regret not having took it as a starter ;-). All fans of chocolate must also try their *gateau chocolat façon grand-mère*. I've never been disapointed by this address but it's been more than a year that I went there.

__Price:__ medium

__Reservation:__ mandatory

__Address:__ Near *les Abbesses* (MONTMARTRE) 29 Rue des Trois Frères, 75018 Paris - +33 1 53 28 00 75

### Bonvivant
Nice wine bar / wooden bistro chic in the middle of the Quartier Latin (studdents area). Bonvivant tries to smartly reinvent some recipes. I highly recommend the *Burrata des pouilles, betteraves croquantes, huile d'olive et Yuzu* and the *Oeuf mimosa du Bonvivant* (starters) and the *Veritable riz au lait aux amandes caramelisées* (dessert).

# Japanese food

### Hokkaido (ramens and other traditionnal japanese food)
My favorite classical Ramen restaurant in Paris (next to OPERA). The place has been fully renewed, but this is an old institution. Everything is simple but good.

__Price:__ cheap

__Reservation:__ not possible. You just have to follow the queue in the Street 

__Address:__ next to OPERA - 14 Rue Chabanais, 75002 Paris - +33 1 42 60 50 95

### KODAWARI RAMEN (high quality and original Ramens)
Discovered recently thanks to Laurent DOGUIN, I'm crazy about it. Top quality products, reinvented recipes of Ramens, Japanese sounds recorded in the streets played as background ambiance. YOU MUST try it if you are 2 or 3 people to eat because the only drawback is the size of this tiny shop. Highly recommended

__Price:__ cheap-medium

__Reservation:__ not possible. You just have to follow the queue in the Street 

__Address:__ next to ODEON - 29 Rue Mazarine, 75006 Paris - +33 9 70 91 12 41

__Price:__  medium-high

__Reservation:__ mandatory up to 4 people

__Address:__ next to Montparnasse - 5 Rue Léopold Robert, 75014 Paris - +33 1 43 20 87 14
